<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Beef Stroganoff is a Russian dish consisting of tender beef strips cooked with onions and mushrooms in a creamy sour cream sauce, offering a comforting and flavorful meal typically served over egg noodles or rice. It's celebrated for its rich texture and harmonious blend of savory flavors.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Beef (such as sirloin or tenderloin), thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>Mushrooms, sliced</li>
    <li>Sour cream</li>
    <li>Beef broth or stock</li>
    <li>Butter or oil</li>
    <li>Garlic, minced (optional)</li>
    <li>Flour (for thickening the sauce)</li>
    <li>Worcestershire sauce (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Egg noodles or rice (for serving)</li>
</ul>

<h2> </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Thinly slice the beef, onions, and mushrooms. Mince the garlic if using.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of butter or oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef slices and cook until browned on all sides, then transfer them to a plate.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of butter or oil. Add the sliced onions and mushrooms, and cook until they are softened and lightly browned, about 5-7 minutes. If using garlic, add it during the last minute of cooking.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the flour over the onions and mushrooms, stirring to coat evenly. Cook for 1-2 minutes to remove the raw flour taste.</li>
    <li>Gradually pour in the beef broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Once the sauce has thickened, return the browned beef slices to the skillet. Stir in the Worcestershire sauce if using. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the mixture simmer gently for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the sour cream until it's well incorporated and the sauce is creamy.</li>
    <li>Serve the Beef Stroganoff hot over cooked egg noodles or rice. Garnish with parsley if desired.</li>
