<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Irish stew is a traditional dish hailing from Ireland, typically made with lamb or beef, potatoes, onions, carrots, and sometimes other root vegetables. It's known for its hearty and comforting nature, often simmered slowly to create tender meat and a rich, flavorful broth.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Lamb or beef (cut into chunks)</li>
    <li>Potatoes (such as Russet or Yukon Gold, peeled and diced)</li>
    <li>Onions (sliced)</li>
    <li>Carrots (peeled and sliced)</li>
    <li>Stock or broth (beef or vegetable)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Fresh herbs (such as thyme or parsley)</li>
    <li>Optional: other root vegetables like turnips or parsnips</li>
</ul>

<h2> </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Wash, peel, and chop the potatoes, onions, and carrots. Cut the lamb or beef into bite-sized chunks if it's not already prepared.</li>
    <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add the meat and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. This step helps to develop flavor.</li>
    <li>Once the meat is browned, add the onions, carrots, and potatoes to the pot.</li>
    <li>Season the mixture with salt, pepper, and thyme. Stir everything together to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour the beef or vegetable broth into the pot, making sure it covers all the ingredients. If necessary, add additional water to ensure everything is submerged.</li>
    <li>Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a lid and let the stew simmer gently for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the vegetables are cooked through. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking and to help flavors meld.</li>
    <li>Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning if needed, adding more salt and pepper if desired.</li>
    <li>Once the stew is ready, ladle it into bowls and garnish with chopped parsley if desired. Serve hot, accompanied by crusty bread or a simple salad if desired.</li>
